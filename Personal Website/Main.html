            <span>THIS IS ME. RYNE A SMALL AND SIMPLE BUT TERRIBLE GIRL FROM BAIT-1B</span>
            <p>I am Freshman student at Queazon City University and I'm currently taking BSIT course. Basic things about me is that I'm always grumpy or maldita. Yes, I might be grumpy most of the time but I am still a softhearted eagirl who cries at everything that a simple raising your voice at me will make me cry. The things that I love the most is Travelling, It's actually my dream to travel world. Besides travelling, some of my hobbies are Watching movies, anime, kdrama, or any series. I also love to listen to any music whenever I'm alone, play online games with my friends and most importantly is to Study. Yess!! I love to study it might not show physically but I do love to study. My zodiac sign is Leo a dramatic but feisty eagirl. I am 19 years old and counting. My petpeeves are eating loudly, non-hygienic, and disrepectful. I only have motto and that is "What give to me is what you get so if you bitch then I'm gonna bitch you too for sure."

              <span>ONE OF MY SKILLS IS CREATING GRAPHIC ARTS OF PEOPLE, PLACE, ANIMALS, AND THINGS.</span>
              <p>Here is my tribute artwork for my late uncle's death anniversary. Creating artwork was an idea that I had in mind on pandemic era. I was so bored and got curious on what my brother was doing. At first he just taught me the basic things but eventually, I created an artwork of someone that end up so good. Thats why since then it became my part time job. I earned a lot of money through making artworks like this and different kind of artworks like sticker paint and I even tried working on e-commerce company as a student trainiee, but sadly it ended too fast because I had to go to school and it will divert my attention between studies and work. I was so sure that it will probably affect my studies and it did so I had no choice but to resign. But yes It was a fun journey that I had way back pandemic era.</p>
